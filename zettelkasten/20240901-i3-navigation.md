# i3 navigation

I love using marks to navigate. No need for idiotic crap like "navigate to
workspace one with CMD+1 and then focus the browser with ALT+TAB", just show the
fucking browser. But they have some weird issues I have not gotten around
fixing.

From time to time I lose marks for applications like Firefox and Steam. Which is
annoying, especially the browser as it's one of the most used ones. I suspect
it's related to launching a new window, which possibly disassociates the
underlying mark.

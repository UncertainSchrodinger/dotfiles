### Nix Update visibility is bad

When using pacman I could always see what packages would update and do I want to
update them. Like if the gpu drivers would update, I'd usually postpone it
until work was done.

With nix I don't have a single clue what it's going to update. Sure there are
generations and I can always rollback. But still, I'd like to see what is being
updated.

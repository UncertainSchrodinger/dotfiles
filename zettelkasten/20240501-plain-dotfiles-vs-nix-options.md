### Plain dotfiles vs nix options

I'm torn on just configuring applications by hand rather than nix options. The
options hide underlying tools, I'd never learn how to configure these tools. And
if I ever have issues then I need to understand the configuration. If I ever
want to stop using NixOS I have to rewrite all my configuration files.

I'm more leaning on the fact that it's not a good idea to use nix options too
much. If I were just starting linux use I for sure would not use options, way
too much magic.

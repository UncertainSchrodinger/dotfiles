# My zettelkasten and private notes

My current zettelkasten is simple. I don't have any special syntax for
referencing. Only the name serves as the index.

Simplicity was always the main goal. While orgmode like tools seem cool, and I
might have to revisit them. Zettelkasten won't solve time tracking or todo
lists.

Directories are used for structure and for now it's flat. Just a `zettelkasten`
directory and all notes go under it. I store all of these notes under my
dotfiles for easy distribution.

One glaring issue being private notes, especially work notes. Obviously most of
the stuff in those cannot be public. How do I handle this? For now I'm leaning
to having two 'boxes'. One for public notes in my dotfiles and one for private
ones, maybe in another repository.

Since my method of creating notes is tedious and manual, I hope there's less
chance for error. I just hope it's not so tedious, that I stop using this
method.

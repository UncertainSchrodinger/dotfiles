# Sets the correct positions and sizes for applications I always use.  The
# position values might look a bit strange. These position values are relative
# to my primary display. My primary display is positioned in the middle of my
# other displays, two are portrait and the middle one is landscape. This is why
# the y coordinate is negative, as the portrait displays are higher in relation
# to my middle display.
#
# All of the applications need to be started before this script is ran.
#
# TODO: It would be nice of this script would work on different display layouts.
#       Usual scenarios are just working on the laptop monitor or with one
#       display if I'm at a client. Or working with all three.
# TODO: Supporting relative sizing would be sweet. When I finally buy 4k
#       monitors this script will fail.

tell application "System Events" to tell application process "Chrome"
    tell window 1
        set {size, position} to {{1440, 1285}, {-1440, -567}}
    end tell
end tell
